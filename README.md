AlternativeVote-atron
=====================

Takes a csv file as input (exported from Drupal Webform, see
example_input.csv), runs and AV election on them (Christ's College JCR style)
and outputs a (kind-of) nice markdown results sheet.

```
# To run
$ ./count.py input.csv > output.md

# To run unit tests
$ ./test.py
```
